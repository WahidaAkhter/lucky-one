      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  Question 1:How React works?<br>
  Answer: React is a JavaScript library which we can use to make user interface.React reads objects and uses them to
  create html element in virtual dom and then it gets synched in real dom.And then we can just show it to our ui.React
  is needed for single page applications.React does not commit state changes one after another instead it goes through
  virtual dom and make changes and compares that needed to be in the real dom and all does it in one single process.it
  is open source js library so it is easy to use to make readable user interface. <br>
  Question 2: props vs state? <br>
  Answer:(1)props are immutable where state is mutable. <br>
  (2)sate can be defines in the component itself,where props should be pass form parent components. <br>
  (3)props cannot be modified where state can be modified by using setState(). <br>
  (4)props are read only and state changes can be asynchronous. <br>
  (5)props make componens reusable where state cant.
